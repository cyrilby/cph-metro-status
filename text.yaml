warning_mapping_many_dates: "There are {unmapped_msg_n} metro status messages that have not yet been classified in terms of their impact on service status. This means that in the period {unmapped_msg_date_min}-{unmapped_msg_date_max}, the numbers in the 'Unknown' category may be overestimated and the numbers in the 'Normal service' and 'Disrupted service' categories may be underestimated.

  The chart below shows the daily service reliability of the Copenhagen metro. The **disruption score** plotted on the chart is calculated in the following way:

  <span style="color:#28b09c">⬤</span> If service has been **running normally** or has been affected by planned maintenance on any given day, then the disruption score will be 0 and the day will be plotted with a **green background** on the chart.

  <span style="color:#fed16a">⬤</span> If service has been affected by at least one **partial disruption** or delay, then the disruption score will be 1 and the day will be plotted with a **yellow background** on the chart.

  <span style="color:#fe2b2a">⬤</span> If service has been affected by at least one **complete disruption** or delay, then the disruption score will be 2 and the day will be plotted with a **red background** on the chart.

# Text shown on the "Method info" page
# ====================================
meth_page_desc: "This page describes how the data that serves as the backbone of this app is collected from the **source** and what kind of **assumptions** are made in the calculations."
meth_msg_1: "The Copenhagen metro's [website](https://www.m.dk) provides **real-time information** on their operating status in the form of an **on-screen banner**."
meth_msg_2: |
  - Data on the metro's operational status is sourced from their website **once every 10 minutes**, producing a total of up to 6 records per hour. In theory, the data could be downloaded every minute, giving us an even greater level of detail, however, the decision to limit the fetching to once every 10 minutes was made out of consideration for limiting the impact on the server side.
  - Data is fetched for each metro line where the relevant **status message** is recorded alongside a **timestamp** showing when the check was made.
  - Any newly downloaded data is **appended to a table** containing all previous historical records (this table is then further processed by adding custom calculated columns and such).
  - In some cases, it may not be possible to fetch any new data. Should that be the case, an **"Unknown" status** will be assigned to the respective timestamp.
  - When the data is aggregated to **calculate % of time** for e.g. normally
  running service or disruption, we divide the number of entries in each status group by the total number of entries in the selected time period. Any duration-related metrics are therefore **approximations rather than exact numbers**.
  - While it is only the metro team that has access to the most fine-grained data and therefore able to provide the exact numbers, due to the data in here being sourced at frequent and regular intervals, the **approximation** of the actual picture they provide can be considered to be **very good**.
meth_msg_3: 'A separate **mapping table** that allows us to group the "raw" status messages into separate categories (e.g. "Normal service" or "Disruption") and that allows for recording the impact on stations in a standardised manner is **maintained manually**.'
meth_msg_4: |
  - Status messages are mapped by the author of this app **once a week** as a minimum, sometimes more often. If there are any unmapped service messages, a **banner** will be displayed in the app, informing the user of the potential impact of the missing mapping (typically, missing mapping will lead to **more "Unknown" entries**, therefore underestimating the % of time where the metro was either running according to schedule or suffering from a disruption).
  - For the sake of **transparency**, the entire mapping table is printed below:
meth_msg_5: "The web scraping tool is not without its faults and as such, it is possible for some days to not have any data collected. This can be due to a variety of reasons, including OS crashes, temporary lack of internet access, power outages, etc. Periods with known system downtime are by default included in the insights but can be filtered out by using the *'Showing data'* slicer:"
meth_msg_6: "For the sake of transparency, all known periods of system downtime, including the reasons behind them, are shown below:"
